# Recursion

Recursion is a super difficult concept, but it's vital to succeed in the rest of CS 61A. Here are a few resources that you could use to help practice recursion, and also understand the recursive leap of faith.

## Difficult (Exam-level) Questions

  - Highly recommend watching this, or at least understanding how to do this! When I did this question for the first time while taking the exam, I think I finally understood what the recursive leap of faith meant; trusting that the function will eventually be correct, and just using the function definition to figure out what calling a smaller version of the case will do was seriously useful.
